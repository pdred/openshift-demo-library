# Demo (or Lab) of a Blue/Green Deployment Pipeline in OpenShift

The intent of this demo is to represent how an Operations or Middleware Ops team can use a Blue/Green Deployment approach to rolling out an application into production.

For the purpose of speed and simplicity, this demo uses the `deployment-example` container that ships with OpenShift Container Platform.

This content can be run purely as a demo (Presenter does everything while audience watches) or as a hands on Lab where the audience gets to log into the demo cluster and play the part of Application Development Teams.
